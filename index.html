											<h2>An Introduction to E-learning</h2>
											<p>&nbsp;</p>
										</header>
										<p>
										  E-learning can contribute to teaching, learning and research activities. The effective and efficient use thereof in an online environment is often dependent on the fulfillment of other strategies, such as the integration of web-based components into curricula and equipping learner and staff with up-to-date, relevant knowledge and skills.

												<h3>Something else</h3>
											</header>
										<p>
										  The integration of e-learning in teaching and learning can enhance quality education by contributing towards the provision of student-centered learning experiences that are flexible, responsive and meet the needs of all learners. Embedding an online component into the curriculum means that a learner cannot reasonably be expected to meet the learning outcomes of the course without accessing or engaging with the electronically delivered or -supported components of the course. Therefore, the success of online learning and teaching depends on the effective inter-operation of all systems supporting the learner, and will enable a flexible and independent learning experience.

												<h3>So in conclusion ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											  No doubt, it is equally important to take forward the concept of non-electronic teaching with the help of books and lectures, but the importance and effectiveness of technology-based learning cannot be taken lightly or ignored completely. It is believed that the human brain can easily remember and relate to what is seen and heard via moving pictures or videos. It has also been found that visuals, apart from holding the attention of the student, are also retained by the brain for longer periods. Various sectors, including agriculture, medicine, education, services, business, and government setups are adapting to the concept of E-learning which helps in the progress of a nation.
